       My name is Brian Samuels. I am a Software Engineer just getting into the industry. In December of 2020 I had decided that I wanted to change my career entirely from being in automotive to going into the tech sector. So far it has been one of the most rewarding experiences I have had. I was able to learn so much in such a short amount of time and it has been so much fun! I have been able to learn how to make some super awesome things and I am excited to see where the rest of this field is able to take me!
